        <p>Even at school, I was interested in programming and wanted to enter a good educational institution in order to get high-quality knowledge. When I came here, I realized that there is a lot of competition in programming and it is difficult to find a job. In the first year, I didnâ€™t really understand anything, it was easy to learn some subjects, such as those passed at school.</p>
        
        <h2 id="now">Nowadays</h2>
        <p>Years later, I learned a lot about this field, found out that there are many directions in this profession, and decided to choose one of them. At this time, I am studying and gaining experience, and around the summer to go to an internship</p>
